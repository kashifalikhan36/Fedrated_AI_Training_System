# Fedrated_AI_Training_System
## Inspiration  
We always dreamed of fine-tuning the latest AI models, but training them was too expensive for small teams like ours. One day, we looked at an unused gaming PC and thought, what if anyone could share their GPU to help train AI? That idea became the start of.

## What it does  
Fedrated_AI_Training_System enables fine-tuning of the latest open-source large models in a **decentralized** way. This drastically reduces hardware costs and allows users with idle GPUs to earn money. As a result, anyone can train AI models at just **1/10th of the usual cost**.

## How we built it  
We started with just a couple of laptops and a few RTX GPUs from our friends. We connected them over a secure network, built a basic server to assign training tasks, and figured out how to merge model results. Step by step, **TrainChain** came to life.

## Challenges we ran into  
We faced failures constantly. It’s incredibly difficult to utilize distributed hardware for a single fine-tuning task. We experimented with various algorithms to make decentralized AI training work. Sometimes, GPUs would stop responding during training, leading to data loss and syncing issues. But every problem made us think harder and grow stronger. We debugged everything in one night and built the first beta version of our app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Successfully ran a distributed training session using real GPU clients on different hardware (PCs, laptops, etc.)  
- Designed a working **reward mechanism** using blockchain principles, allowing contributors to earn similar to crypto mining  
- Built a **proof-of-concept** system that actually reduces training costs  
- Created a **user-friendly interface** for both contributors and developers  

## What we learned  
We learned about decentralized digital contracts and discovered how blockchain can be applied beyond finance, like integrating it with AI training systems. We also explored **Web3 technologies** and the process of creating our own crypto coin to streamline this project and potentially launch a real-life startup.

## What's next for TrainChain  
We plan to scale this project to an **industrial level**. Currently, we have a bunch of laptops and computers ready for initial deployment. We’re also investing in a better UI for both users and clients to improve experience and adoption. Our goal is to make TrainChain the go-to platform for **affordable AI training**, accessible to everyone.
Additionally, we are planning to integrate **Azure ML Foundry** and **Hugging Face** so users can securely upload their custom data and models, and train them privately with full control.
